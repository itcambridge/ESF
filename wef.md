\## ESF Website – WEF-Inspired Refinement Plan



\### Purpose

Refine the ESF single-page website to achieve a calm, authoritative, WEF-like feel \*\*without copying layout or branding\*\*.  

The goal is institutional credibility, systems clarity, and stakeholder trust — not persuasion or activism.



---



\## Phase 1 — Visual \& Design Foundations (Must come first)



\### Objectives

\- Establish a coherent visual system

\- Reduce visual noise

\- Create a calm, institutional baseline



\### Tasks

1\. Create a \*\*design tokens system\*\*:

&nbsp;  - Primary color: ESF cyan

&nbsp;  - Neutral palette: warm off-white / buff backgrounds

&nbsp;  - Accent usage rules (cyan used sparingly)

&nbsp;  - Standard border radius (e.g. 16–20px)

&nbsp;  - Standard shadow levels (light / hover)



2\. Normalize global styles:

&nbsp;  - Body background color

&nbsp;  - Section padding and margins

&nbsp;  - Card background, radius, and elevation

&nbsp;  - Button styles (primary, secondary, text link)



3\. Introduce subtle \*\*vertical gradients\*\* between major sections:

&nbsp;  - Gradients should fade softly top-to-bottom

&nbsp;  - No hard color blocks or sharp transitions



---



\## Phase 2 — Typography \& Hierarchy



\### Objectives

\- Achieve WEF-style calm authority

\- Let hierarchy do the work, not contrast or boldness



\### Tasks

1\. Finalize typography system:

&nbsp;  - Primary font: Inter

&nbsp;  - Define scale for:

&nbsp;    - H1 (hero statements)

&nbsp;    - H2 (section anchors)

&nbsp;    - H3 (card titles)

&nbsp;    - Body text

&nbsp;    - Captions / metadata



2\. Apply typography consistently:

&nbsp;  - Increase line-height for readability

&nbsp;  - Reduce excessive bold usage

&nbsp;  - Ensure headings rely on spacing, not color



3\. Ensure text never “shouts”:

&nbsp;  - Avoid all-caps

&nbsp;  - Avoid high contrast color blocks behind text



---



\## Phase 3 — Hero Section Refinement



\### Objectives

\- Make the hero feel calm, confident, and institutional

\- Set the tone for the entire page



\### Tasks

1\. Refine headline:

&nbsp;  - Shorten line length

&nbsp;  - Keep declarative, systems-focused language



2\. Soften hero gradient:

&nbsp;  - Reduce saturation

&nbsp;  - Blend into page background naturally



3\. Refine CTAs:

&nbsp;  - Primary CTA: invitational (e.g. “Explore the model”)

&nbsp;  - Secondary CTA: neutral text link

&nbsp;  - Avoid sales-style language



4\. Refine explainer card:

&nbsp;  - Lighter background

&nbsp;  - Smaller heading

&nbsp;  - Tight, precise copy



---



\## Phase 4 — Section Rhythm \& Narrative Flow



\### Objectives

\- Make the page feel like a guided walk

\- Avoid scroll fatigue



\### Tasks

1\. Standardize section structure:

&nbsp;  - Section title

&nbsp;  - One short explanatory sentence

&nbsp;  - Content (cards, tools, tables)



2\. Improve vertical rhythm:

&nbsp;  - Add breathing room between sections

&nbsp;  - Avoid stacking dense sections back-to-back



3\. Add subtle section transitions:

&nbsp;  - Soft gradient fades

&nbsp;  - Light dividers where needed



---



\## Phase 5 — Card \& Component System



\### Objectives

\- Make the site feel deliberate and engineered

\- Eliminate bespoke one-off components



\### Tasks

1\. Create reusable card components:

&nbsp;  - Research cards

&nbsp;  - Centre cards

&nbsp;  - Analysis cards

&nbsp;  - Stakeholder cards



2\. Standardize:

&nbsp;  - Padding

&nbsp;  - Heading size

&nbsp;  - Body text

&nbsp;  - Link style (“Learn more →”)



3\. Add restrained hover states:

&nbsp;  - No movement jumps

&nbsp;  - Light shadow or background shift only



---



\## Phase 6 — Language \& Tone Alignment



\### Objectives

\- Maintain neutrality and inclusivity

\- Focus on systems, not blame



\### Tasks

1\. Review copy site-wide to ensure:

&nbsp;  - Analytical, non-ideological tone

&nbsp;  - Systems framing over moral framing

&nbsp;  - No “us vs them” language



2\. Replace loaded terms where possible:

&nbsp;  - “failure” → “imbalance”

&nbsp;  - “capture” → “misaligned incentives”

&nbsp;  - “distortion” → “asymmetric pressure”



3\. Ensure every section answers:

&nbsp;  > Who is this for, and why should they feel safe engaging?



---



\## Phase 7 — Stakeholder Table UX (Signature Feature)



\### Objectives

\- Make this feel like a serious policy tool

\- Match WEF-level data presentation quality



\### Tasks

1\. Improve table usability:

&nbsp;  - Sticky header row

&nbsp;  - Clear column hierarchy

&nbsp;  - Muted grid lines



2\. Refine filters:

&nbsp;  - Pill-style filters with consistent spacing

&nbsp;  - Smooth interactions (no reflow jumps)



3\. Add context:

&nbsp;  - One-line explanation above table:

&nbsp;    “Explore where groups with different views share system goals.”



4\. Ensure mobile usability:

&nbsp;  - Horizontal scroll

&nbsp;  - Clear affordances

\## Phase 8 — Institutional Credibility Signals



\### Objectives

\- Signal continuity, seriousness, and legitimacy



\### Tasks

1\. Strengthen footer:

&nbsp;  - Clear separation between:

&nbsp;    - Forum

&nbsp;    - Research

&nbsp;    - Engage

&nbsp;  - Neutral tone throughout



2\. Add mission reinforcement:

&nbsp;  - Short mission sentence above footer links



3\. Avoid marketing language:

&nbsp;  - No urgency cues

&nbsp;  - No hype language

\- No high-contrast or neon elements

\- No political messaging

\- No startup pitch language

\- No ideological positioning

\## Guiding Principle



> ESF is not opposing Davos — it is revealing the system beneath it.  

> Design should signal clarity, calm, and long-term thinking.
